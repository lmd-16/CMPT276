[1 marks] What is the difference between Git and Github?
Git is a version control system that's accessed from the command line and can be used offline. It allows us to track changes made to code, create backups of different versions of the code and enables team-based coltouch .gitignore
open .gitignorelaboration and development. On the other hand, Github is a web-based platform that is hosted on Git. It reflects changes we've pushed to Git from our local machines enabling all changes to be visible to the collaborators.

[2 marks] What is a distributed version control system?
A distributed version control system type of control system where developers have clones of the repository and its history on their local machines allowing for offline use. They can then make changes and push their copy to the server repository thus allowing developers to collaborate with each other.

[1.5 marks]Explain the 3 states of git in your words.
State 1: 
    Modified: The first state where we have made changes to a file but not yet committed it to the git server 
State 2: 
    Staged: The second stage where we've added the file to the git server but not yet committed it. 
State 3:
    Committed: The last stage where files are permenantly stored in your git repository.

[2.5 marks (0.5 each)] In your own words, describe the following git commands:
git clone : makes a copy of the current repository to work on from your local machine.
git status : enables you to see the current state of the working repository on Git. 
git fetch : fetch enables you to see any changes made to the remote repository but doesn't integrate it into your working directory. 

git init : this allows you to create a new git repo to edit 
git log : enables you to see logs of previous commits of the repository.

[1 mark] What is a .gitignore file and its purpose?
A .gitignore file is a file that contains files for Git to ignore and makes sure that the files stay untracked by Git. It's used for files that are not to be committed so your repository doesn't contain unnecessary files. For example, system specific or IDE files.

[2 marks] Summarize the video into 4-5 sentences
SDLC is the process in which software is conceptualized, developed and maintained. It consists of seven phases: planning requirements, requirement analysis, design, implementation and coding, testing, deployment and maintenance. Planning, requirement analysis, and design, focus on the requirements of the application. On the other hand, implementation, testing, deployment and maintenance contextualize the requirements in the form of a physical product where it's tested, deployed and maintained. 
[2 marks] In your own words, explain why Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is important in software projects.
Planning the project enables us to look at specific requirements, dependencies and shortcomings that we might not have considered when looking at the big picture. It allows us to look into more detail of the requirements of the project and any risks or issues that might arise. Software development can be expensive and time-consuming therefore, SDLC is a time-efficient and cost-effective approach to software development.
